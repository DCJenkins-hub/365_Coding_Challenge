<h1>Regarding Links and images</h1>

<p>Links and images are essential components of web pages, allowing users to navigate between pages and view visual content. Here’s a brief overview of how to use them in HTML:</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links are created using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor)
    tag. The <code>href</code> attribute specifies the destination URL of the link. Here’s an example:</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit w3schools.com</a>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Images are added to a web page using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The <code>src</code> attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the <code>alt</code> attribute provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed. Here’s an example:</p>
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">
<p>Remember to always use descriptive text for links and alternative text for images to improve accessibility and SEO.</p>

<h2>Offline storage</h2>
<p>When working with links and images, you can also use offline storage by saving the files locally on your computer. For example, you can download an image and reference it in your HTML file using a relative path:</p>
<p>Create an assets folder to store images</p>
<img src="assets/dog.jpg" alt="A cute dog">
<img src="assets/whale.jpg" alt="A whale">
<p>Make sure to adjust the <code>src</code> attribute to point to the correct location of your image files.</p>
